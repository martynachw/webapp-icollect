                <p class="icollect__paragraph mb-0"> Observing everyday life I noticed problem related with settling costs
                    among groups of people.
                    My project faces the problem of organizing group finances for various goals.
                    Group expenses can be very different - smaller like a gift, bill in a restaurant,
                    and larger like a holiday. In a larger group, settlements get complicated, take a lot of time and often
                    someone forgets to give away their part of the money.
                    Generation Y often organizes expenses with friends. When people organizing events, one of the most
                    difficult issues to be negotiated is finances. I would like to
                    support and help people to organize group financial goals.
                    <br>  
                    I divided my project into four sections: Research, Business,
                    Modeling and Tests. Phase called <span class="text-orange">
                        Research</span> consists analysis and conclusions from qualitative research. I conducted
                    interviews with 10 millennials.
                    <span class="text-orange"> Business </span> is about strategy and development my product on the
                    market.
                    The phase <span class="text-orange">Modeling</span> is necessary for me to show you wireflows, user
                    scenarios etc.
                    And the last phase <span class="text-orange"> Test </span> consists information about usability
                    tests,
                    conclusions and prototype.

                    application on the phone and turn on.
                    Basia creates an account after reading short information how app works. Basia follows the
                    instructions that help her create the first
                    contribution. She defines the purpose and duration her contribution. Then she sets the amount of
                    payments and selects friends.
                    At the end Basia writes a short message and invites selected friends. Basia finally created
                    contribution. She decides to pay for yoursel
                    immediately. It turns out that for this purpose she have to complete the payment details. She adds
                    card details. Then she authorizes the payment.
                    The contribution is ready. Money has been paid to the "piggy bank". Basia can manage contribution
                    among her participants.</p>

                <h6> Basia organizes contribution </h6>
                <p class="icollect__paragraph mb-3"> Basia is 36 years old and she has two children. To avoid losing contacts
                    once a quarter she tries to meet friends.
                    Thanks to these meetings she has not gone crazy because of too much duties.
                    In a month there is another opportunity to meet with friends. Because of birthday party her
                    colleague Benek. It will be be good party in a large group.
                    Basia thinks it could be nice this year to buy a big present for Benek. It's best to start thinking
                    about it now because time flies.
                    It is Thursday evening. Basia decides to take care of the money contribution for a birthday gift for
                    Benek. She opens the iCollect app and creates a new
                    contribution. She writes name of contribution, amount per person, sets the end date chooses
                    participants. She writes a short message: "Hey! I'm organizing a
                    birthday present for Benek, do you want to join? "She sends it to firends and pays for herself.
                    It is Friday afternoon Basia is in the shop and takes a look for app. Seven (out of 10) people
                    accepted the invitation. Some people paid money.
                    Basia is at home, she checks the phone again. Franek rejected the invitation. So the amount for the
                    gift will be reduced.
                    Two weeks gone, soon will be the end of the contribution. But Ania has still not paid. Basia knows
                    that the app sent Ania a reminder, but she did not react.
                    Basia decides to give Anna the last chance and extends the contribution for another three days.
                    Three days later she still do not see payment from Ania.
                    The application announces the end of contribution. In the "money box" is less money than Basia
                    provided. The money is already in the application </p>
                <h6 > Basia disburses money collected during the contribution </h6>
                <p class="icollect__paragraph mb-3"> Basia is a 36-year-old, English translator and mother of 2 children.
                    Thanks to the iCollect application she collected money
                    for gif for friend named Benek. She collected 100 PLN and with friends Basia will buy dressing-gown.
                    Basia as an organizer is authorized by other participants
                    to buy a gift. She found the right product in the online store, she buys it and choose BLIK payment.
                    Then she opens the iCollect application and selects the recently completed contribution. She uses
                    the possibility of paying the money collected in contrubution earlier.
                    She decides on a direct transaction with the application using BLIK. She uses the BLIK code
                    displayed in the application on shop website. She authorizes BLIK transaction
                    the previously defined PIN number in app (alternatively: biometric data by scanning the thumb).
                    Finally she bought a gift for Benek. </p>
                <h6> Kewin participates in the contribution </h6>
                <p class="icollect__paragraph"> Kevin is a 25 years old business analyst. Most of the day he spend in
                    the office, where he spends a lot of time after officialy hours. Kewin

                <ul class="icollect__paragraph">
                    <li> During testing, I observed anxiety and uncertainty on the part of users in relation to a new
                        application that asks you to provide your credit card number or provide other data; this behavior of
                        the testers convinced me that the iCollect application should give the user a sense of security from
                        the beginning, visually accentuate that the user can trust her, do not have to worry about
                        depositing her funds into the piggy bank or entering data </li>
                    <li> Still, a little trust in applications related to payments and the provision of some data among
                        Polish millennials may be a barrier to using the iCollect application, so maybe an interesting
                        solution for the project would be to be part of a banking application or an additional component of
                        such application </li>
                    <li> The iCollect application, based on the PSD2 directive, enables users to keep money in premiums in
                        the application; Because it has been implemented in Poland for several months, I think it would be
                        a good idea to explain to users the mechanism in a short and accessible way </li>
